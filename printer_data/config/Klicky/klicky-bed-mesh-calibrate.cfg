# This macro was provided by discord user Garrettwp to whom i give my thanks for sharing it with me.
# I have tweaked it a lot.
# They are based on the great Annex magprobe dockable probe macros "#Originally developed by Mental,
# modified for better use on K-series printers by RyanG and Trails", kudos to them.
# That macro as since evolved into a klipper plugin that currently is pending inclusion in klipper, 
# more information here, https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe/tree/main/Klipper_Macros
# User richardjm revised the macro variables and added some functions, thanks a lot
# by standing on the shoulders of giants, lets see if we can see further
# 
# the current home for this version is https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe

[bed_mesh]
speed: 350
horizontal_move_z: 10
mesh_min: 1,20
mesh_max: 215,235
probe_count: 5,5
algorithm: bicubic
fade_start: 1
fade_end: 10
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
split_delta_z: 0.015
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
move_check_distance: 3
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
mesh_pps: 4,4
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
