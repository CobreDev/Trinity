# Trinity
My Ender 3 to Trinity conversion

## The Build
This is my build of JackMiller's [Trinity V1](https://www.printables.com/model/866079-trinity-v1). More info to come soon

### Filament:
Green: Sunlu Grass Green ABS<br>
Orange: Hatchbox ABS<br>
Black: Sunlu ABS<br>

### Electronics:
This printer is running a BTT Manta M5P with a BTT CB2 for the host. This is a great all-in-one solution with a pretty low footprint.
I'm also running an EBB36 CANbus board on my toolhead, connected to the M5P directly.

### Toolhead:
I recently switched from the stock Voron Stealthburner/Clockwork 2 toolhead, to  KevinAkaSam's [Papilio](https://kevinakasam.com/papilio/) belted extruder with an [A4T](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/A4T/) toolhead. For a hotend I'm using a TZ V6 2.0, which is a fantastic budget hotend that can use regular V6 nozzles.

### Modifications:

- [Bed Cable Strain Relief](https://www.printables.com/model/212186-ender-3-pro-90deg-heated-bed-cable-strain-relief)
